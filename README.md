TEST CASES ANALYSIS


<b> Test Case B: Random Sequence </b>
  For this test case, the number of memory blocks is 4n where n is the number of cache blocks. Unlike the first test case, the sequence has no order and memory blocks are inserted into the cache blocks at random. <br>

  In this case we set the number of cache blocks to 2, which will give us a total of 8 memory blocks.
